Well, looky here, looky here, ahh, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holdin'

"I love you so" (Hey) That's what you'll say (That's what you'll say)
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away" (Don't go away)
But when I play (But when I play), I never stay (I never stay)
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby
